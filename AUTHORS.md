### 👨‍🦰 On my own matter:
---
### ⛔ Our Pledge:⛔
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, 
we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and 
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, 
body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### ⚙️ Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

Using welcoming and inclusive language
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Focusing on what is best for the community
Showing empathy towards other community members
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, 
without explicit permission.
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### ✔️ Our Responsibilities:
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and 
are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, 
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions 
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or 
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### ✔️ Scope:
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and 
in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or 
its community. Examples of representing a project or 
community include using an official project e-mail address, 
posting via an official social media account, or 
acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### ⛔Enforcement:⛔
Instances of abusive, harassing, 
or 
otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by 
contacting the project team at: kurschristian@gmail.com. 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and 
will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. 
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

All Developers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct 
in good faith may face temporary 
or 
permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
