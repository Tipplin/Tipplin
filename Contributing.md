#### Before you start working on something announce your intention on the mailing list (or in comment in tracker).
#### Make sure your PR doesn't contain unneccessary changes (whitespaces, new lines, ...).
#### Consider squashing your commits.
#### Follow existing code formatting/styling (even for new files).
#### Make sure you swept all corners (i.e. all build configurations are fine, works with all InterBase 2017 or later, etc.).
#### Make sure your changes merge without conflicts.
#### Consider backward compatibility.
#### Don't be afraid to ask (i.e. backward compatibility).
#### Be prepared to do some changes after your PR is reviewed.
#### Consider whether your change is benefit for majority of users (opposite to only a small group).
